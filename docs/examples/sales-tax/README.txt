NOTE: This example uses the original callback API.
See https://github.com/voxgig/seneca-promisify for an async/await API.

A walkthrough of these examples is given in the github README:
https://github.com/senecajs/seneca

There some dependencies (https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect etc)
Install them first: `npm install`

Run them using these shell commands, in this sequence:

node sales-tax.js
node sales-tax-config.js

You can run the full test with `npm test`, which also serves as a
example of usage.

And also, from the perspective of logging:
